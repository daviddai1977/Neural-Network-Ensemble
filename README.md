# Neural-Network-Ensemble
I modified the neural network from this great online book: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html
Its implementation is now fully vectorized so that it's faster.
I added more features such as: locally adapting weights, choice for hidden layers,
choice for output layer, choice for cost function,
choice for weight initialization, constricting the norm of the weight matrices,
decaying learning rate and early stopping etc.

Other resources I used:
Information on pre-conditioning the network: https://www.willamette.edu/~gorr/classes/cs449/precond.html
Python Machine Learning book: https://www.google.com/shopping/product/12511808324724036203/specs?sclient=psy-ab&espv=2&site=webhp&q=python+machine+learning&oq=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.&bvm=bv.132479545,d.cWw&biw=1422&bih=467&dpr=1.5&ion=1&sns=1&pf=i&tch=1&ech=1&psi=XXDVV4jwCYKz-wH95qCQDw.1473605724781.1&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwih_4uPyYfPAhUCHD4KHVAOBYkQuC8IoQE
